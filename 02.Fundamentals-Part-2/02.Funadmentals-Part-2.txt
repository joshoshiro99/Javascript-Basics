-What are the eight data types in JavaScript?
1. string
2. numbers (float)
3. big int 
4. booleans
5. null
6. undefined
7. symbol
8. object

-Which data type is NOT primitive?
object

-What is the relationship between null and undefined?
null represents a value of nothing. It belongs to no other datatype. undefined refers to a value that has not been assigned a value at all. In a case where you would declare a variable without assigning a value the undefined variable is automatically assigned. When programmers want to declare a variable and assign a value but are not sure what value will be assigned it is recommended to use the null variable to replace the undefined.

-What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?
Single and double quotes will create a string however you cannot use the same quote type within a string as the enclosing type as it will cause string creation problems. Backtick quotes are used to create template strings: `Hello, ${name}!`.

-What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?
This is referred to as a template literal.

-Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?
Backtick quotes `string`

-How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?
Use backtick quotes and then ${valiable/expression}: 
`${variable/expression}`

-How do you escape characters in a string?
use the backslash before the characters: "Hello \nWorld!'

-What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string methods?
slice: extracts a string using the two indices provided, negative values will count from the end
substr: extracts a string using the beginning index and a length
substring: extracts a string using two indices, however negative values will be treated as zero

-What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
&& AND: will return false with any false value  
|| OR : will return true with any true value
!  NOT: will return the opposite value provided

-What are the comparison operators?
<, >, ==, ===, <=, >=, !=

-What are truthy and falsy values?
These result and are calculated from boolean operations
falsy values are anything like: 0, empty string, null, undefined, NaN
truthy values are anything else with a value

-What are the falsy values in JavaScript?
falsy values are anything like: 0, empty string, null, undefined, NaN

-What are conditionals?
conditionals look at a boolean operation, evaluate it and if true will execute code underneath. This allows for branching paths. 

-What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?
if (conditional){
    code
}
else {
    other code
}

-What is the syntax for a switch statement?
switch (conditional){
    case choice1:
        code;
        break;
    case choice2:
        code;
        break;
    default:
        run this code if all else fails;
        break;
}

-What is the syntax for a ternary operator?
condition ? run this code : run this code instead;
in other words
isTrue ? return true: return false;

-What is nesting?
nesting is placing an ifelse within another if else statement:

if (this is true){
    if( this is also true){
        execute this code;
    }
    else (first is true but second is false){
        return this;
    }
}
else {
    first is false return this;
}
