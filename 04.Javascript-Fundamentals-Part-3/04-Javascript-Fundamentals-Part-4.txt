-What are functions useful for?
Functions are useful for reusing sections of code 

-How do you invoke a function?
You invoke a function by writing the function name and inluding any arugments in parenthesis.
e.g. functionName();

-What are anonymous functions?
anonymous functions are functions that do not have a name listed. This is commonly used when a function requests a function to be passed as an argument.
e.g. 
(function () {
 alert('hello');
})

-What is function scope?
function scope is the codespace that the function can see and edit. Scope prevents from functions altering the variables that allow other functions to 
work.

-What are return values?
Return values are what a function will hand off to the next line of code. If a return value is not provided the function will hand off undefined. 

-What are arrow functions?
Arrow functions are a way to write simple functions more efficiently. 
e.g. 

let sum = function(a, b){
 return a+b;
};

becomes

let sum = (a,b) => a + b;
