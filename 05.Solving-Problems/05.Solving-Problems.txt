-What are the three stages in the problem solving process?
1. understand the problem
2. plan the resolution
3. break into sub-problems and solve

-Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?
You could waste time solving a completely different problem

-What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?
You can pseuo-code, break it down step by step, or try and explain the problem to another person (or rubber duck). All of these will poke holes is your understanding of the problem.

-What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?
In the planning stage of the problem solving process you should identify the user interface, the inputs and outputs and finally how the inputs change to give the correct outputs.

-What is an algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem.

-What is pseudocode?
Psuedocode is writing out the algorithm in easy to digest language. 

-What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?
The advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems prevent the programmer from trying to solve a big ambiguous problem. This prevents the complexity of the entire problem from wearing one out.
