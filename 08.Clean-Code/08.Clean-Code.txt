Why is it important to write clean code?
-Writing clean code makes code easier to read and allows for easier documentation of the function. This makes it easier to understand weeks after writing it or when someone else is writing the code. 

Name 5 clean code principles previously mentioned
1. Revise the logic of the code before writing it. 
2. Use consistent indentation.
3. Break functions down into smaller ones.
4. Use a naming standard for variables and functions.
5. Don't abuse comments, use them to explain why a particular methodology was used.

What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?
Good comments add authorship to the code. or explain why a particular algorithm was used.
Bad comments clutter the code and overexplain functions that could be better explained with proper variable and fucntion names.
